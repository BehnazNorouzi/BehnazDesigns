        This is one of the UIs that I have prototyped for automating the study guide in Lappeenranta University of Technology. Some UIs like this sample were a bit complicated, since lots of information needed to be shown in a single page.

        This prototype was developed using Proto.io in a CodeCamp in a group of 3 Person including me. The idea was for another group-mate. I had a role in prototyping and also I made an animated video presentation using PowToon. Please find some views of this prototype in this video.

        A wireframe for software and application innovation course with real customers (Organizers of  World Ski Championship 2017 in Lahti). It was a group work and my idea for using RFID technology+app to solve the problem of toilet visiting during the event was approved by other group-mates. The whole prototype was created by me with Balsamiq. In the last page of this file please find links to our presentation. Also the presentation in Prezi and all graphics used in presentation is created by me.
